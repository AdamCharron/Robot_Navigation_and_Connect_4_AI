As part of a team, created a fully autonomous, heavily budget-constrained robot capable of navigating obstacles, locating and retrieving 
balls, and scanning a game board for strategic placement to play a game of Connect 4 against an opponent. 
Balls would be retrieved from dispensers semi-randomly dispersed throughout a game board, with a Connect 4 board at one end. 
These dispensers would be found, balls retrieved, and transported to the Connect 4 board, where they would be dropped into the board to 
play a real-time, non-turn-based version of Connect 4 against another robot on the other side of the board, performing the same task. 

The Robot_Navigation_and_Connect_4_AI.ino file contains the code for the simple implementation of the following functions:
- AI for the Connect 4 sub-game
- Code for object retrieval and disposal
- Simple ultrasound-based localization and navigation
- Code for sensor interaction and subsequent situation analysis
